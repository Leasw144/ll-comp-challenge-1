# Overview
For this comp challenge, we had to create a mock html page that in some form another, captured the spirit of the original file below. I hadn't really nailed down an overall theme which is why it's basically just a bunch of different drawing of Sailor Moon I just so happened to have on my local machine.

As you can see, I went for an old 90's anime feel for the color scheme but Sailor Moon's presence gives it a more femenine look than intended

## Challenges
It'd been awhile since I touched CSS and it shows. Getting a good grasp on how grid worked and how to divide up the grid for the navigation bar probably took up the longest time to get around and was ultimately what held me back. 

It wasn't until I looked over a few Youtube tutorials that things started to click-unfortunately, it was a bit too late to make any significant changes to the doc before the due date. 

Additionally, I didn't realize until late into the game that the way I had stylized my header would be the same for all of the cards displayed, so I had to go back and add in images and files to make it more varied.

## Some Victories
While getting the nav bar area was a hassle, I got it to look vaguely to how I'd wanted it which was a small but nice win. As mentioned before, things didn't really click until the final day but it was solid practice nonetheless.

## Resources
